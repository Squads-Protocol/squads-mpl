SMPL is a collection of programs for creation and management of multisig wallets on Solana.

Currently SMPL contains:

  * Squads V3 on-chain program: powerful multisig wallet for teams and secure individuals
  * Program manager: supporting program to manage program upgrades with Squads V3

Technical information about SMPL [can be found in the program README.md](https://github.com/squads-dapp/squads-mpl/blob/main/programs/squads-mpl/README.md)

# Our vision

Solana needed a multisig the ecosystem could rely on, so we built one.

# Security

To make sure that Squads V3 is secure we did the following:
  * independent security audit with [Bramah Systems](https://github.com/Squads-Protocol/squads-mpl/blob/main/Squads_V3_Audit_Bramah.pdf)
  * independent security audit with [OtterSec](https://github.com/Squads-Protocol/squads-mpl/blob/main/Squads%20V3%20-%20OtterSec%20Audit.pdf)
  * running the [Sec3](https://pro.sec3.dev/) premium tool after any changes to the on-chain code
  * written the program in [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/) (a framework for quickly building secure Solana programs)
  * kept the codebase minimal
  * open sourced the codebase
  * asked a number of established teams in the ecosystem to review the code and give their feedback
